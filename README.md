Machine Learning semi automatic labeling to categorize dataset of images in unsupervised manner

# Task

Try to categorize dataset of images in unsupervised manner
The idea is to ignore dataset labels and categorize images and texts with unsupervised algorithms. Which algorithm you 
should decide. You may use more than one algorithm in order to compare them. You should implement all preprocessing and visualisation.
Here is two datasets: ([Fashion mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), [Caltech 256](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/caltech256)) code should work on both
